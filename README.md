## Installation guide
To use Graa-Synth, you first need to have Csound installed on your machine. Installation is fairly straight forward, and you can find the download for the Csound installer here: https://csound.com/download.html

Once Csound is installed, download the .exe and .csd files provided in the /application directory of this GitHub project, they need to be stored in the dame directory on your system to work. Once this is done, the synth should now work properly when booting the .exe file.
